  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <section>
    <p>I’m an electrical engineering technology student at Purdue University’s main campus, graduating in December 2026. Before transferring into Engineering Technology, I spent two years in Electrical and Computer Engineering, which gave me a strong foundation in circuit theory, digital systems, and programming alongside hands-on lab work.</p>

    <p>These days my focus is on analog systems, power distribution, diagnostics, and practical problem-solving with real hardware. I’m most comfortable behind an oscilloscope with a circuit on the bench, but I also have working experience in CAD and simulation tools such as AutoCAD, Fusion 360, Eagle, Multisim, and SPICE.</p>

    <h2>Projects and Skills</h2>
    <p>Nearly everything on this site was built from scratch as a personal learning project. My <a href="projects.html">projects page</a> highlights work that combines analog and digital design, from laser systems to embedded controllers and audio visualizers. I enjoy the challenge of creating complete working hardware and software stacks rather than stopping at theory.</p>

    <p>My homelab is one of my proudest accomplishments: a multi-node Proxmox cluster running a full self-hosted service stack including a local large-language-model instance, all powered by reclaimed hardware. Building it entirely from spare parts and open-source tools taught me more about networking, systems administration, and distributed design than any class could.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>I became an engineer because I love making things work—whether that’s troubleshooting a power circuit or assembling a new machine from scrap. The more I learn, the more tools I gain to create. My long-term goal is to keep turning ideas into functioning devices and eventually run projects on a larger scale, both professionally and independently.</p>

    <h2>Beyond Engineering</h2>
    <p>I live on the north side of Indianapolis. Outside the lab, I’m into weightlifting, hiking, camping, cooking (I even wrote a cookbook), and leatherworking. Those hands-on hobbies keep me grounded and creative, and often influence the mechanical side of my engineering projects.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>Right now I’m seeking opportunities where I can keep building—roles that value practical problem-solving, electronics expertise, and a willingness to learn quickly. I want to work with people who make real things, then come home and build more for fun.</p>
